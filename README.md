# The famous HZ-model

In [this article](https://www.academia.edu/611024/Generating_Scale-free_Networks_with_Adjustable_Clustering_Coefficient_Via_Random_Walks)<sup>1</sup>, the authors present an algorithm to generate [scale-free Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network) with **adjustable clustering coefficient**.

The algorithm uses a *random walk* procedure combined with a triangle formation scheme, so that new triangles will be formed based on a vertex attribute. The distribution of this attribute all over the network vertices will determine the network's final clustering coefficient.

This algorithm is well-known for its accuracy in the creation of a power-law graph with an aimed clustering coefficient and for the fact that it is based only on local information.
